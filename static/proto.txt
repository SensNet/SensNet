== Sensor -> Node protocol version 2==

Definitions:
<int>: 32bit signed integer
<uint>: 32bit unsigned integer
major version: breaking change
minor version: non-breaking change
punctuation is only for clarity.

Proto:
<2 byte> version[first byte: major, second byte: minor]{0x02 0x00}, <2 byte> SensorId,<byte> sensortype, <int> lat, <int> long, <byte> battery, <uint> timestamp, <byte> ttl, <byte> rssi (assumed positive), <byte> length, <byte[length]> data

The TTL is to be increased with each hop form sensor to sensor and limited to 8bit. If ttl == 255 is reached, the packet must be droped to avoid endless circles.
