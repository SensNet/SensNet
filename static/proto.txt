== Sensor -> Node protocoll version 1.2==

Definitions:
<int>: 32bit signed integer
<uint>: 32bit unsigned integer
<float>: 32bit signed float
major version: breaking change
minor version: non-breaking change
punctuation is only for clarity.

Proto:
<2 byte> version[first byte: major, second byte: minor]{0x01 0x02},<byte>sensortype, <2 byte> SensorId, <int> lat, <int> long, <byte> battery, <uint> timestamp, <byte> ttl, <2float> data, <byte> rssi (assumed positive)

The TTL is to be increased with each hop form sensor to sensor and limited to 8bit. If ttl == 255 is reached, the packet must be droped to avoid endless circles.
